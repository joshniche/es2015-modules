This is a quick demo to show how ES6 modules behave. Requires [node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

You can view the modules at [`/src/breakfast.js`](src/breakfast.js) and [`/src/lunch.js`](src/lunch.js).

Getting started is easy, just run:

```npm install

npm start```
